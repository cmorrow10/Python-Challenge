##### The objective is to develop a Python script for the examination of financial records contained within the "budget_data.csv" dataset. This dataset consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
##### The script is designed to compute and extract the following financial metrics:
##### - The total number of months included in the dataset.
##### - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
##### - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
##### - The average of those changes.
##### - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
##### - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
